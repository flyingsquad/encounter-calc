The encounter calculator uses the tables from the Combat Encounter Difficulty section of the DMG, page 82.

Tokens with the friendly disposition and actors of type "character" with token vision active are assumed to be characters. The vision active flag is used in case there are NPCs of actor type character.

Tokens with the neutral disposition are ignored in the calculation.

Tokens with the secret or hostile disposition are included in the difficulty calculation. 

Actors of type 'character' are assumed to have a CR of one-half their character level (and corresponding XP) if the experience is zero. Set the character's experience to the amount of XP rewarded for defeating the character if you want more control.
